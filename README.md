LKWBlitz Vergleicher

Project Summary

LKWBlitz Vergleicher is an interactive web application designed for SMEs in the logistics sector, aimed at facilitating the comparison of transportation rates from different carriers quickly and reliably. Users can enter key parameters (origin, destination, cargo type, urgency, restrictions, etc.) and retrieve real-time rates through integration with the Shipo API.

The project is built using Angular for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, with a MySQL database managed in DBeaver. Development followed an Agile methodology, using GitHub for version control and Jasmine for unit testing, ensuring system reliability and modularity.

Planned future improvements include:

Expanding Shipo API integration to include shipment tracking and advanced validations.

Integrating additional APIs, such as ProXio Systems, to estimate COâ‚‚ emissions and incorporate sustainability criteria.

Developing AI algorithms to provide optimized transport recommendations based on cost, time, and environmental impact.

Preparing for cloud deployment and scalability, aiming to commercialize the application as a complete solution for SMEs.

Key technologies:

Frontend: Angular

Backend: Node.js, Express

Database: MySQL

Version control: GitHub

Unit testing: Jasmine

APIs: Shipo API, ProXio Systems (planned)

Expected impact:
The project delivers a functional, scalable, and flexible tool that helps SMEs make more informed logistics decisions, considering cost, time, and environmental sustainability.
